          Just make sure you are either close to the MAX line, are within downtown,
          or have other transportation available.  Visit the
          = link_to "transportation", "/pages/transportation"
          page for more transit details.

        I'll let Google help you decide what hotels you might want; here's an embedded map located around the Hilton, but you can easily
        use public transit if you stay anywhere on the Max line.  You can use Google to view all of the public transit options and view the
        = link_to "transportation", "/pages/transportation"
        page for more information.

          The 
          = link_to "MAX", "http://trimet.org/max"
          , portland's above-ground train is a convenient way to travel in the city,
          especially when the destination is in or around Downtown Portland (like the wedding).It also goes directly into the Portland International Airport so you can ride it
          into the city off the plane.
        %p
          If you want to stay without renting a car then just make sure you're close enough
          to a MAX line that it's convenient for you.

            Even if you don't stay near the MAX Line, Portland has a lot of 
            = link_to "buslines", "http://trimet.org/bus"
            that service a large portion of the city.  Additionally we have some 
            = link_to "streetcar", "http://trimet.org/streetcar"
            services within downtown and on the inner southeast side.

            can help plan out any trips you might need (if Trimet's planner isn't adequate).
            One nice detail is the Trimet fare system covers all of their transit methods: 
            The Max, Streetcar and Bus Lines.

"An h1 header
============

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, `monospace`. Itemized lists look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex. \"it's all in chapters 12--14\"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.



An h2 header
------------

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. 

### An h3 header ###

Now a nested list:

1. First, get these ingredients:
  * carrots
  * celery
  * lentils

2. Boil some water.

3. Dump everything in the pot and follow this algorithm:

    find wooden spoon
    uncover pot
    stir
    cover pot
    balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
    wait 10 minutes
    goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including that last line which continues item 3 above). Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar). Here's a link to a [localdoc](local-doc.html).

Tables can look like this:

size  material      color
----  ------------  ------------
9     leather       brown
10    hemp canvas   natural
11    glass         transparent

Table: Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of

(The above is the caption for the table.) Here's a definition list:

apples
  : Good for making applesauce.
oranges
  : Citrus!
tomatoes
  : There's no \"e\" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Alternately, put blank lines in between each of the above definition list lines to spread things out more.)

Done."
